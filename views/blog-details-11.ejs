                                    <h4><strong>Types of Diabetes Mellitus</strong></h4>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Type 1 Diabetes:</strong> Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system mistakenly targets and destroys the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. This disruption impairs the body's ability to regulate blood sugar levels, requiring individuals to manage their condition through insulin therapy and other treatments. This type typically manifests in childhood or adolescence but can occur at any age. Individuals with Type 1 diabetes require lifelong insulin therapy.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Type 2 Diabetes:</strong> The most common form, Type 2 diabetes, is often associated with obesity and lifestyle factors. Insulin resistance occurs when the body’s cells don’t respond effectively to insulin, or when the pancreas isn’t able to produce sufficient insulin. It can develop at any age but is more prevalent in adults.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Gestational Diabetes:</strong> Gestational diabetes develops during pregnancy and usually goes away after giving birth. However, it can elevate the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes in the future.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Other Specific Types:</strong> These include monogenic diabetes, cystic fibrosis-related diabetes, and diabetes caused by other conditions or medications.</li>
                                    </ul>
                    
                                    <h4><strong>Symptoms and Diagnosis</strong></h4>
                                    <p>Common symptoms of diabetes include:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Increased thirst and hunger</strong></li>
                                        <li><strong>Frequent urination</strong></li>
                                        <li><strong>Unexplained weight loss</strong></li>
                                        <li><strong>Fatigue</strong></li>
                                        <li><strong>Blurred vision</strong></li>
                                        <li><strong>Slow-healing sores or frequent infections</strong></li>
                                    </ul>
                    
                                    <h4><strong>Diagnosis is typically confirmed through blood tests, including:</strong></h4>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Fasting Blood Sugar Test:</strong> Measure blood glucose after an overnight fast (typically 8-12 hours) for accurate results.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT):</strong> Assesses blood glucose levels before and after consuming a sugary drink.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Hemoglobin A1c Test:</strong> Indicates average blood sugar levels over the past two to three months.</li>
                                    </ul>
                    
                                    <h4><strong>Pathophysiology of Diabetes Mellitus</strong></h4>
                                    <p>Diabetes Mellitus is a multifaceted metabolic condition marked by persistent high blood sugar levels. This occurs due to issues with insulin production, insulin effectiveness, or a combination of both. Understanding the pathophysiology of diabetes involves exploring the mechanisms underlying the different types of the disease and how these mechanisms lead to hyperglycemia and its complications.</p>
                    
                                    <h4><strong>Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM)</strong></h4>
                                    <p>Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition where the immune system erroneously targets and destroys the beta cells in the pancreas that produce insulin. The pathophysiology of T1DM can be summarized as follows:</p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li><strong>Genetic Susceptibility:</strong> Certain genetic factors increase the risk of developing T1DM. The HLA-DR and HLA-DQ genes are strongly associated with this condition.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Autoimmune Response:</strong> Environmental triggers, such as viral infections, may initiate an autoimmune response in genetically predisposed individuals. This response leads to the production of autoantibodies against pancreatic beta cells.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Beta Cell Destruction:</strong> The autoimmune attack results in the gradual destruction of beta cells, leading to a significant reduction in insulin production. This process can occur over months or years.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Insulin Deficiency:</strong> As beta cells are destroyed, insulin levels fall, leading to increased blood glucose levels. Without insulin, glucose cannot enter cells and be utilized for energy, resulting in hyperglycemia.</li>
                                    </ol>
                    
                                    <h4><strong>Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM)</strong></h4>
                                    <p>Type 2 diabetes is characterized by insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency. The pathophysiology of T2DM involves several interrelated factors:</p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li><strong>Insulin Resistance:</strong> Tissues, particularly muscle, liver, and adipose tissue, become resistant to the effects of insulin. This means that higher levels of insulin are required to achieve the same glucose uptake and utilization.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Beta Cell Dysfunction:</strong> Over time, the pancreatic beta cells become dysfunctional and fail to secrete enough insulin to overcome insulin resistance. This dysfunction is exacerbated by glucotoxicity (high glucose levels) and lipotoxicity (high free fatty acid levels).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Increased Gluconeogenesis:</strong> The liver increases glucose production, contributing to hyperglycemia. Insulin normally inhibits gluconeogenesis, but in T2DM, this inhibitory effect is diminished.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Genetic and Environmental Factors:</strong> A combination of genetic predisposition and environmental factors such as obesity, sedentary lifestyle, and poor diet contribute to the development of insulin resistance and beta cell dysfunction.</li>
                                    </ol>
                    
                                    <h4><strong>Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM)</strong></h4>
                                    <p>Gestational diabetes occurs during pregnancy and involves similar mechanisms to T2DM:</p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li><strong>Hormonal Changes:</strong> Pregnancy hormones, particularly human placental lactogen, increase insulin resistance to ensure a continuous supply of glucose to the fetus.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Inadequate Insulin Secretion:</strong> The pancreas may not produce enough insulin to compensate for the increased insulin resistance, leading to hyperglycemia.</li>
                                    </ol>
                    
                                    <h4><strong>Pathophysiological Effects of Hyperglycemia</strong></h4>
                                    <p>Chronic hyperglycemia, regardless of the type of diabetes, leads to various complications due to its toxic effects on tissues and organs:</p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li><strong>Glycation of Proteins:</strong> Excess glucose binds to proteins, forming advanced glycation end-products (AGEs). AGEs alter the structure and function of proteins, contributing to vascular complications.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Oxidative Stress:</strong> Hyperglycemia increases the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to oxidative stress and tissue damage.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Inflammation:</strong> Chronic high glucose levels induce inflammatory responses, contributing to the development of diabetic complications.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Microvascular Complications:</strong>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li><strong>Retinopathy:</strong> Damage to the retinal blood vessels, leading to vision impairment and blindness.</li>
                                                <li><strong>Nephropathy:</strong> Damage to the kidneys, leading to proteinuria and chronic kidney disease.</li>

                                            </ul>
                                        </li>
                                        <li><strong>Macrovascular Complications:</strong> Increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, such as coronary artery disease, stroke, and peripheral artery disease.</li>
                                    </ol>
                    
                                    <h4><strong>Management and Treatment</strong></h4>
